6. Zigzag Conversion
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

string convert(string s, int numRows);
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
Example 2:

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
Example 3:

Input: s = "A", numRows = 1
Output: "A"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), ',' and '.'.
1 <= numRows <= 1000

            # take the str "PAYPALISHIRING" for example:
            # We start with variable index with the value 0, step with the value 1
            # Each row added with the next char
            # If we reach the bottommost row, we need to turn to the next above row, so we change the step value to -1
            # we keep the step value until we reach topmost row. DON'T CHANGE IT!
            # Again, if we reach the topmost row, we need to reset the step value to 1
            # What we need to remember is:
            # the zigzag pattern is just a pictorial image for us to have a better understanding
            # What the trick of algorithm is actually add the next char of the given string to different rows.
            # Don't really think how to move the cursor in the matrix.
            # It's really misleading way you think of this. Even it works, it's not efficient.
