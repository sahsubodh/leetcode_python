186. Reverse Words in a String II
Given a character array s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by a single space.

Your code must solve the problem in-place, i.e. without allocating extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = ["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]
Output: ["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]
Example 2:

Input: s = ["a"]
Output: ["a"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is an English letter (uppercase or lowercase), digit, or space ' '.
There is at least one word in s.
s does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
All the words in s are guaranteed to be separated by a single space.
