159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters
Given a string s, return the length of the longest 
substring
 that contains at most two distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "eceba"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring is "ece" which its length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "ccaabbb"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring is "aabbb" which its length is 5.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of English letters.
